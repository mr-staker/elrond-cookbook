## Dockerfiles

These are Dockerfiles for thick containers, simulating a proper VM with systemd and everything rather than a simple container with sshd as entry point which is the default for kitchen-docker. This allows much better system testing without the time penalty to spawn a fully fleged VM using Vagrant.
